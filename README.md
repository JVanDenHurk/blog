# My Blog
Welcome, come check out my current tech events. see what I'm tinkering with.

## 🛠️ What You'll Find Here
- **Writeups** – Mostly beginner-to-intermediate CTFs like OverTheWire, Hack The Box, and more.
- **Tools & Scripts** – Quick one-offs and reusable stuff I’ve made or tweaked.
- **Notes** – From privilege escalation paths to binary analysis snippets.
- **Tips** – Small things that saved me hours, maybe they'll help you too.

## 🧠 Why I'm Doing This
This blog is a living document of my skills and personal projects. I learn best by doing, and by documenting my journey, I not only solidify my understanding but also share what I’ve learned with others who might find it useful. This isn’t a polished, formal tutorial site, it’s a real-time, evolving collection of my work in cybersecurity and tech.
