# My Protfolio

Welcome to my portfolio where I showcase my journey through the world of hacking, cybersecurity, and tech-related projects.

This portfolio is hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), and it's where I highlight my skills, projects, and learning experiences — from Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges to custom tools and scripts. Whether it's a security vulnerability I’ve identified, a script I’ve written, or an innovative solution I’ve built, this portfolio is a reflection of my work and growth.

Welcome to my little corner of the internet where I share my journey through the world of hacking, cybersecurity, and all the rabbit holes I fall into.

## 🛠️ What You'll Find Here
- **Writeups** – Mostly beginner-to-intermediate CTFs like OverTheWire, Hack The Box, and more.
- **Tools & Scripts** – Quick one-offs and reusable stuff I’ve made or tweaked.
- **Notes** – From privilege escalation paths to binary analysis snippets.
- **Tips** – Small things that saved me hours, maybe they'll help you too.

## 🧠 Why I'm Doing This
This portfolio is a living document of my skills and personal projects. I learn best by doing, and by documenting my journey, I not only solidify my understanding but also share what I’ve learned with others who might find it useful. This isn’t a polished, formal tutorial site – it’s a real-time, evolving collection of my work in cybersecurity and tech.
