## 🛠️ What You'll Find Here

## 🧠 Why I'm Doing This
This blog is a living document of my skills and personal projects. I learn best by doing, and by documenting my journey, I not only solidify my understanding but also share what I’ve learned with others who might find it useful. This isn’t a polished, formal tutorial site, it’s a real-time, evolving collection of my work in cybersecurity and tech.
