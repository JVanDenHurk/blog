# Hack This and That Blog

Welcome to my little corner of the internet where I share my journey through the world of hacking, cybersecurity, and all the rabbit holes I fall into.

This blog is hosted with [GitHub Pages](https://jvandenhurk.github.io/ctf-blog/), and it’s where I document what I’m learning — from walkthroughs and writeups, to tools, scripts, failed experiments, and small wins. Whether it’s a CTF challenge, a cool command-line trick, or a brute-force script that finally worked, it all lives here.

## 🛠️ What You'll Find Here
- **Writeups** – Mostly beginner-to-intermediate CTFs like OverTheWire, Hack The Box, and more.
- **Tools & Scripts** – Quick one-offs and reusable stuff I’ve made or tweaked.
- **Notes** – From privilege escalation paths to binary analysis snippets.
- **Tips** – Small things that saved me hours, maybe they'll help you too.

## 🧠 Why I'm Doing This
I’m learning by doing — and by writing it all down, I learn better and maybe help someone else too. This isn’t a polished tutorial site. It’s raw, real, and evolving.

## 🔍 Featured Writeups
