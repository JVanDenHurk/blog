        <h2>NorthStar Consulting Project – Part 2: Scenario</h2>
        <p class="date">Published: August 31, 2025</p>
        <p>The company has grown to <strong>7 staff members</strong> and until now, they've been working in a <strong>workgroup setup</strong>. Each computer has its own local login, files are scattered between OneDrive and USB sticks, and the Director is concerned about <strong>data security</strong> and <strong>scalability</strong> as the company continues to take on more clients.</p>
        <p>The Director's request: "We need a central login system, secure file storage by department, and a way to make sure HR and Accounts data stays private. Keep it simple, but make it scalable for when we grow."</p>
        
        <p><strong>Current Staff & Departments</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Sarah Brown (Director)</strong> – Needs access to everything, but is not technical.</li>
            <li><strong>John Smith (Consultant)</strong> – Works with client documents, needs a shared folder with other consultants.</li>
            <li><strong>Emily Jones (Consultant)</strong> – Same as John, but often works remotely (may need VPN later).</li>
            <li><strong>Alex White (Reception/Admin)</strong> – Handles scheduling, general documents, and shared office resources.</li>
            <li><strong>Maria Green (HR)</strong> – Stores contracts, staff records; needs confidential access.</li>
            <li><strong>James Black (Marketing)</strong> – Works with creative files, social media content.</li>
            <li><strong>Linda Grey (Accounts)</strong> – Handles invoices and payroll, very sensitive data.</li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        <p><strong>Business Problems (Why You're Here)</strong></p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>User management is chaotic</strong> – Every PC has a different password, so resets take ages.</li>
            <li><strong>No security separation</strong> – Anyone can access HR or Accounts documents if they know where they're saved.</li>
            <li><strong>No central file share</strong> – Staff are emailing files back and forth, creating duplicates.</li>
            <li><strong>No policies</strong> – USBs are widely used, which is a risk for malware or data leaks.</li>
        </ol>
