        <p>
            Finally recieved my <strong>Optiplex 7060</strong> but before I start the installation of proxmox, I just want to add a few bits of hardware. 
            One hard drive and 16gb DDR4 RAM. I wasn't going to add extra RAM but I just happen to find some laying around, So why not? 
        </p>
        <p>
          As for the hard drives, I do have some old HDDs laying around but I think they will be to loud.
          See, the problem is my server is located in my bedroom. So I will want to try and keep it quiet as possible.
          Instead, I will be stealing my SSD from my PC. (No moving parts means no noise) I figured I already have the 1TB M2 in my PC and I never fill it. 
          So, taking the 1TB SSD and actaully using it seems like the smarter option.
        </p>
        <p>
          With these upgrades my server current stats are looking pretty good for my first homelab.

          <ul>
            <li><strong>CPU:</strong> Intel i7 8700 3.20GHz</li>
            <li><strong>RAM:</strong> 32GB RAM DDR4</li>
            <li><strong>Storage:</strong> 512GB M2 SSD + 1TB SSD</li>
            <li><strong>Form Factor:</strong> Tower</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          Next part, I'll be setting up and install proxmox.
