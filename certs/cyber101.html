        <p>
        Networking is the backbone of cybersecurity, and this section gave me a strong foundation in how devices communicate, how data travels, and how we can analyze and secure that communication. From basic models to real-world tools, I explored how everything connects.
        </p>

        <h3>Networking Concepts</h3>
        <ul class="bullet-list">
          <li><strong>OSI & TCP/IP Models</strong><br/>Got to grips with how data moves through different layers of a network, from physical wires all the way up to applications.</li>
          <li><strong>IP Addresses & Subnets</strong><br/>Learned how devices are assigned unique addresses and how subnetting helps organize and secure networks.</li>
          <li><strong>TCP vs UDP</strong><br/>Explored the differences between reliable (TCP) and fast (UDP) protocols and when to use each.</li>
          <li><strong>Encapsulation</strong><br/>Understood how data is packaged and passed through layers to reach its destination.</li>
          <li><strong>Telnet</strong><br/>Used Telnet to connect to remote machines and saw how insecure protocols work under the hood.</li>
        </ul>
