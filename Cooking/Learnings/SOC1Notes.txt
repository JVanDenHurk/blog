************ Hash Values ************

Hash Values are fixed length set of characters that uniquely identifies data.

A hash function takes input data and returns a fixed-length output, known as a hash or digest.

Hashing algorithms

- MD5 (Message Digest 5)
    - Returns a 128-bit hash value (typically represented as a 32-digit hexadecimal number).
    - Often used to verify the integrity of files or data.
    - No longer considered secure for cryptographic purposes due to vulnerabilities; not recommended for sensitive applications.

-SHA-1 (Secure Hash Alorithm 1)
    - Returns a 160-bit hash value (a 40-digit hexadecimal number).
    - Deprecated and banned for use in digital signatures since 2013 due to known collision vulnerabilities and susceptibility to brute-force attacks.

-SHA-2 (Secure Hash Algrithm 2)
    - Replace SHA-1
    - SHA-2 has many variants
    - SHA-256 is the most commonly used
    - Returns a 256-bit hash (64-digit hexadecimal number).

Why Hashes Matter
By comparing two hash values, you can determine whether a file is original, modified, malicious, or suspicious.

************ IP Addresses ************

IP Addresses are identifiers for devices connected to a network.

************ Domain Names ************

A string of text mapped to a IP Address.

Punycode is a way to represent Unicode characters (like characters from other alphabets or emoji) using only ASCII, so they can be used in domain names.

While it has legitimate uses (like supporting non-English languages), it can also be abused in phishing attacks.

Attackers use lookalike characters (e.g., Cyrillic "Ð°" instead of Latin "a") to create domains that appear identical to real ones, like apple.com.

shorten domain is also another way.

************ Host Artifacts ************

Host Artifacts are traces of what the attack has left in the system. This could be, registry values, suspicious processes, malicious files or anything exclusive to the current threat.

************ Network Artifacts ************

Network Artifacts are traces left on the network. This could be user-agent string, C2 information, or URI patterns followed by the HTTP POST requests.
