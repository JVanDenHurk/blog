The Pyramid of Pain shows how hard it is for a hacker when you block different parts of their attack.

Very handy video to watch: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjblMxfUfHs

Hash Values
- Hash Values are fixed length set of characters that uniquely identifies data.

- A hash function takes input data and returns a fixed-length output, known as a hash or digest.

Hashing algorithms

- MD5 (Message Digest 5)
    - Returns a 128-bit hash value (typically represented as a 32-digit hexadecimal number).
    - Often used to verify the integrity of files or data.
    - No longer considered secure for cryptographic purposes due to vulnerabilities; not recommended for sensitive applications.

-SHA-1 (Secure Hash Alorithm 1)
    - Returns a 160-bit hash value (a 40-digit hexadecimal number).
    - Deprecated and banned for use in digital signatures since 2013 due to known collision vulnerabilities and susceptibility to brute-force attacks.

-SHA-2 (Secure Hash Algrithm 2)
    - Replace SHA-1
    - SHA-2 has many variants
    - SHA-256 is the most commonly used
    - Returns a 256-bit hash (64-digit hexadecimal number).

Why Hashes Matter
By comparing two hash values, you can determine whether a file is original, modified, malicious, or suspicious.

IP Addresses
- IP Addresses are identifiers for devices connected to a network.

Domain Names
- A string of text mapped to a IP Address.

- Punycode is a way to represent Unicode characters (like characters from other alphabets or emoji) using only ASCII, so they can be used in domain names.

- While it has legitimate uses (like supporting non-English languages), it can also be abused in phishing attacks.

- Attackers use lookalike characters (e.g., Cyrillic "Ð°" instead of Latin "a") to create domains that appear identical to real ones, like apple.com.

- shorten domain is also another way.

Host Artifacts
- Host Artifacts are traces of what the attack has left in the system. This could be, registry values, suspicious processes, malicious files or anything exclusive to the current threat.

Network Artifacts
- Network Artifacts are traces left on the network. This could be user-agent string, C2 information, or URI patterns followed by the HTTP POST requests.

Cyber Kill Chain
################

Cyber Kill chain consists of 7 stages that describe the key objective during a cyber attack.

Recon
- Source information to understand their target. Methods include scanning networks, social engineering and perfomring 
  open source intelligence gathering and collect as much information that can from the public domain.

Weaponisation
- Create or gather the tools, exploits and capabilites that allow them to exploit the vulnerabilities. 
- Building maleware, Crafting Phising attacks, Custom hacking tools.

Delivery
- attacking the victim using the tools they gathered.
- Phishing email attachment, malicious links, vulnerable services, websites or offices.

Exploitation
- once the attack is successfull it will begin excuting and take advantage of the victims system.
- software bugs, misconfigurations, weak authentication mechanisms or missing secuity controls.

Installation
- Installs a persistent mechanism that allows them to take control of the system. The mechanism will withstand againts password resets, system reboots or security updates.
- registry run keys, scheduled tasks, cron jobs, Window services and windows startup folder.

Command and Control
- commucate with the victim and control their system. allowing the attacker to exploit the victim.
- exfiltrating data, escalating privileges and perfomring lateral movment within the network.

Actions On Objectives
- Attcker achieving their goals.
- exfiltrating data, gaining access to specific machines, sabotaging infrastructure, perfomring espionage or deploying ransomeware.
